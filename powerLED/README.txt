Automate:

This project is based on an Arduino, a PowerLED shield and a RF433MHz transmitter.
It contains some sensors: temp, humidity, distance (for water level detection).
It also contains a 256KB of memory, LCD screen with a keyboard.
The sensors values are sent to a RaspberryPi on a regular basis.
The HW is home-made, the SW also.
The result: automation of a large part of a fish tank.
