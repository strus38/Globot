# Globot

Arduino/RPi or other DIY projects.

## Automated OTA chicken door

An automated chicken door based on Arduino mini pro with over-the-air firmware update capability (ESP8266 Wifi module) consumming the lowest power as possible (2 x 1.5V battery)

## Automated Egg Incubator

-V1 - An Arduino based fully automated egg incubator. 2016: 4 chicken were born...

-V2 - Same with SSR relays and better egg roll system. The code ha sbeen revisited slightly since no time to add PID algo as planned. 01/05/2017: 8 eggs put in incubator: 4 non-fertilized, 4 dead before the term... error on humidity control.

- V3 - Same as V2 but revisited setup of the incubator. 05/09/2017: 15 eggs put in the incubator => 8 non-fertilized, 7 fertilized, 5 born (3 rosters, 2 hens)

- V4 - Completly new setup - Wooden box, brand new PID setup, new humidifyier, new egg-roller mechanism. Arduino replaced by Raspberry Pi to enable out-of the box capabilities like Amazon Alexa driven interface to get the temperature/humidity, as well as driving the relays for fan/motor with voice control. Egg planned in February 2018.

## Automated FishTank

An arduino based Power LED/Temp controller for fish tank... other stuff are coded but not used in my installation. This setup is in PROD since 2011.
